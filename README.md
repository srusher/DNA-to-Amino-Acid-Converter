# Where to Look?:

The application can be found in the 'src' folder, in the DNA.java and Amino_Acid_Converter.java files. The DNA.java file contains the DNA class which defines the fields and
methods that the DNA class will utilize. The Amino_Acid_Converter.java contains the Main function which executes the code

# What does this program do?:

This application prompts the user for a text file that contains the DNA sequence. It will then break the DNA string into 3 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) which each contain a
a different set of codons. The program will then look at each ORF and determine which amino acid it is associated with and print the amino acid below each codon. See an example
output below:
